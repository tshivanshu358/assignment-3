DevOps Intern Assignment


Objective: Set up a simple CI/CD pipeline for a web application using
 GitHub Actions that automates testing and deployment to a cloud platform.


Tasks:


Create a basic web application (you can use frameworks like Flask for Python
 or Express for Node.js) of your design.


Write a couple of unit tests for the application.


Use GitHub Actions to set up a CI/CD pipeline that:


Runs the tests on every push to the repository.


Deploys the application to a free-tier cloud service like Heroku if the tests
 pass.


Document the pipeline steps and the reasons behind the tools chosen for the
 CI/CD process.


Deliverables:


The source code for the web application.


The unit tests added to the application.


The
.yml file for the GitHub Actions workflow.


A README file with a detailed explanation of how to run the application and
 the pipeline.


A report explaining the CI/CD process, tool choices, and how the setup can
 be scaled for larger applications.
